**NOTES:**

- Several items indicate "Act for IVI", the point is that the authority level is intrinsic in the credential.  Typically, IVI is a customer and the credential only serves to identify and authorize IVI.
- Several credentials are listed as not being restricted.  These are less restricted than others and may be made available to trusted people working on IVI Foundation business.  They are not limited to the designated owner and backup, although the owner/backup are responsible for managing them as described below.
- Credentials with a primary owner of the President may be utilized at the discretion of the IVI BoD
- Credentials with a primary owner of the TC Chair may be utilized at the discretion of the IVI Technical Committee
- Credentials with a primary owner of the Treasurer may be utilized at the discretion of the IVI BoD
- Several credentials are used to _authorize_ other users.  For example, the SharePoint credentials are used to specify the privilege level of other users, up to and including authorizing full administrative privileges.  In these cases, the IVI processes (such as the Operating Procedures) dictate how/who/when a user is authorized.  The credentials identified here are those that represent the IVI Foundation and are the ultimate authority to authorize/deauthorize appropriate users based on documented IVI Processes.
- The administrator (if listed) has access to the credentials and acts on behalf of the owner for IVI.  They are not permitted to share credentials with others.

## Delegating Authority

All credentials have an identified owner and backup.  In general the backup is authorized to utilize the credential as needed.  If owners will be unavailable for extended period, they may designate someone from an IVI member company or the IVI management company to act on their behalf in their absence (and only in their absence)

From time-to-time IVI may hire or appoint a temporarily-authorized-user to perform work on behalf of the foundation that requires one of restricted credentials. In that case at the discretion of the credential owner with approval from the backup, that temporarily-authorized-user can be authorized to use the credential for a fixed period of time.  After the time elapses the credential shall be changed so the temporarily-authorized-user no longer has access (probably requires generating new secrets).

## Updating Credentials

Credentials should be updated annually or when a new person is added with access to sensitive credentials.
